# Dashboard for ASP.NET Core - How to implement Save As and Delete functionality by creating custom extensions

This example demonstrates how to add the "Save As" and "Delete" [menu items](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/117444) to the Web Dashboard's UI by implementing the corresponding [custom extensions](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/117543):

* The "Save As" menu item allows end-users to save the current dashboard with a new name.
* The "Delete" menu item deletes the opened dashboard from the [dashboard storage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116299).

The image below shows the result of the extensions implementation.
